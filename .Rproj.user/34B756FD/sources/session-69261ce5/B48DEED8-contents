## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
ggplot(data = data_cmnn_tdn,  
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = DALY_burden, color = Entity)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Adjust line thickness if needed
  labs(title = "Trend of DALY Burden Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "DALY Burden",
       color = "Entity") +
  theme_minimal() +      # Use a minimal theme for better aesthetics
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Summary of CMNN Burden Findings
The DALYs were high for the three countries between 1990 and 2000. However, in this time period Tanzania had the highest spike reaching over 60,000 in 1997. The DALYs started to decline after the year 2000.
