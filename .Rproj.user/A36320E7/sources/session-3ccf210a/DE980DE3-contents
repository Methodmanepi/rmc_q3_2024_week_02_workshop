# **Non-Communicable Disease Burden (NCD)**

```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, here, knitr)
```

```{r include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary packages
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, here, janitor, ggplot2)
```

```{r include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Import the non-communicable diseases data
data_ncd <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-ncd.csv"))
```

```{r include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Clean names
cleaned_data <- data_ncd %>%
  clean_names()

# Inspect the cleaned column names
colnames(cleaned_data)

# Rename the specific column
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  rename(daly = dal_ys_disability_adjusted_life_years_non_communicable_diseases_sex_both_age_age_standardized_rate, country = entity)

```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
filtered_data_ncd <- cleaned_data %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Nigeria", "Tanzania", "Democratic Republic of Congo"))
 filtered_data_ncd
```

## Table of Estimates for NCD Burden Over Time

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
daly_burden <- filtered_data_ncd %>% 
    select(country, year, daly) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = daly)

    kable(daly_burden, caption = "DALY Burden Over Time for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Tanzania")
```

## Plot Showing Trends in NCD Burden Over Time

```{r  echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.

ggplot(filtered_data_ncd,
  aes(x = year,
      y = daly,
      color = country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "DALY Burden Over Time for DRC, Nigerian and Tanzania",
       x = "Year",
       y = "DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)",
       color = "Country") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Summary of NCD Burden Findings

The DALY burden over time for Nigeria, Tanzania, and the DRC shows a consistent decline across all three countries from 1990 to 2019. Nigeria and Tanzania exhibit a more pronounced and steady reduction in DALY rates, reflecting significant progress in managing non-communicable diseases. The DRC, while also showing a downward trend, has a higher and more fluctuating DALY burden, indicating ongoing challenges in improving public health outcomes.
