# Overall Disease Burden

```{r }
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data
data_overall <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))
```


```{r include=FALSE}
Data1 <-data_overall %>% 
filter(Entity %in% c("Nigeria", "Democratic Republic of Congo", "Tanzania"))
```




##Personal


```{r include=FALSE}
DALY <- janitor::clean_names(Data1) 
view(DALY)

#Rename column with long name
Data_overall_clean <- DALY %>% 
  rename(daly = dal_ys_disability_adjusted_life_years_all_causes_sex_both_age_age_standardized_rate, country = entity)

```


## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
Data_overall_clean %>% 
  pivot_wider(values_from = daly , names_from = country)
kable(Data_overall_clean, caption= "DALYs for NIgeria, DRC, and Tanzania Over time")

```


## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r echo = FALSE, message =FALSE}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
ggplot(Data_overall_clean, aes(x = year,
      y = daly,
      color = country, group = country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "DALYs for Nigeria, DRC, and Tanzania Over time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)",
       color = "Country") +
  theme_minimal()
