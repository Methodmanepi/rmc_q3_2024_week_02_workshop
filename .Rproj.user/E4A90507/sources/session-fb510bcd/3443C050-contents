# Overall Disease Burden

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data
data_overall <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
Dall <- data_overall %>% 
  filter(Entity %in% c("Nigeria", "Democratic Republic of Congo", "Tanzania")) %>% 
      

  
```
```{r}
DALY <- janitor::clean_names(Dall) 
view(DALY)
```


## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
DALY %>% 
  pivot_wider(values_from = dal_ys_disability_adjusted_life_years_all_causes_sex_both_age_age_standardized_rate , names_from = entity)

```

## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
ggplot(data = DALY,  mapping = aes(y = dal_ys_disability_adjusted_life_years_all_causes_sex_both_age_age_standardized_rate, x =  year, group = entity, colour = entity))+
  geom_line( size = 1)
```
